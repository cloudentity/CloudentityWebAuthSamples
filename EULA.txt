Subject to the terms and conditions of this EULA and conditioned upon
LICENSEE'S payment of the license fees, SYNTEGRITY grants LICENSEE a
non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sub-licensable, limited license during the
term of this EULA to use the Software and Documentation solely for internal
purposes in such configurations as specified in the applicable SYNTEGRITY quote
or invoice. The LICENSEE may not distribute or resell the Software in any form,
nor use the Software to construct any product to directly compete with the
Software, unless specifically agreed in writing with SYNTEGRITY. The Software
may include functionality that will render it non-operational upon expiration of
the license. 

                          Section 3 - Scope of Use

    limited to the internal needs of LICENSEE and LICENSEE shall not make the
    Software available to third parties without SYNTEGRITY'S prior written consent.

    this EULA. Maintenance and support services, if any, are provided under a
    separate support agreement.

3.3 Some or all of the Software may be remotely
    hosted or accessible to LICENSEE through the Internet ("Hosted Software"). In
    such case, SYNTEGRITY may suspend, terminate, withdraw, or discontinue all or
    part of the Hosted Software or LICENSEE'S access to the Hosted Software upon
    receipt of a subpoena or law-enforcement request, or when SYNTEGRITY believes,
    in its sole discretion, that LICENSEE has breached any term of this EULA or been
    involved in any fraudulent, misleading, or illegal activities. SYNTEGRITY may
    modify the Hosted Software at any time with or without prior notice to LICENSEE.
    SYNTEGRITY may perform scheduled or unscheduled repairs or maintenance, or
    remotely patch or upgrade the Hosted Software installed on its and LICENSEE'S
    system(s), which may temporarily degrade the quality of the Hosted Software or
    result in a partial or complete outage of the Hosted Software. Updates, patches
    or alerts may be delivered from servers that may be located outside of the U.S.
    SYNTEGRITY provides no assurance that LICENSEE will receive advance notification
    of such activities or that LICENSEE'S use of the Hosted Software will be
    uninterrupted or error-free.

                          Section 4 - Restrictions

                     Section 5 - Intellectual Property

The Software and the Documentation are licensed,
not sold. SYNTEGRITY owns and retains title to the Software and Documentation,
including all intellectual property rights therein. LICENSEE acknowledges that
all intellectual property rights in the Software and the goodwill associated

all rights that are not expressly granted to the LICENSEE hereunder. During the
term of this EULA, LICENSEE grants to SYNTEGRITY a non-transferable,

release, marketing materials).

                 Section 6 - Warranty and Limited Liability

6.1 SYNTEGRITY warrants that, for a period of sixty (60) days, from
    the initial delivery of the Software to LICENSEE, the Software, if used by
    LICENSEE in accordance with the Documentation, shall operate in material
    conformity with the Documentation for such Software. 

6.2 SYNTEGRITY does not
    warrant that the Software will meet all of LICENSEE requirements or that the use
    of the Software will be uninterrupted or error free. SYNTEGRITY's entire
    liability, and LICENSEE'S exclusive remedy, under this limited software
    warranty shall be for SYNTEGRITY: (i) to attempt to correct through reasonable
    efforts, any reproducible material nonconformity discovered within the sixty
    (60) day warranty period; or (ii) to replace the nonconforming Software with
    Software which conforms to the foregoing warranty. 

6.3 In the event
    SYNTEGRITY is unable to cure the breach of warranty described in this Section 6,
    after attempting the remedies described in 6.2(i) and 6.2(ii) above, LICENSEE'S
    sole and exclusive remedy, and SYNTEGRITY'S sole obligation, shall be to stop
    using the Software and SYNTEGRITY shall refund a portion of the license and
    maintenance fees paid by LICENSEE to SYNTEGRITY for the Software. The refund of
    maintenance fees shall be limited to the amount representing the period during
    which the Software showed nonconformity. The above remedies are available only
    if SYNTEGRITY is promptly notified in writing, within the warranty period, upon
    discovery of the nonconformity by LICENSEE and SYNTEGRITY'S examination of the
    Software discloses that such nonconformity exists, and that the Software has not
    been (i) altered or modified other than by SYNTEGRITY; (ii) subjected to
    negligence, or computer or electrical malfunctions; or (iii) used, adjusted, or
    installed other than in accordance with the Documentation.

6.4 THE EXPRESS
    LIMITED WARRANTIES SET FORTH ABOVE ARE EXCLUSIVE AND IN LIEU OF ALL OTHER
    WARRANTIES, EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY WITH RESPECT TO THE SOFTWARE, AND
    SYNTEGRITY EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING WITHOUT
    LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE
    NONINFRINGEMENT, TITLE, SATISFACTORY QUALITY, ACCURACY, OR SYSTEM INTEGRATION,
    OR (B) ARISING FROM ANY COURSE OF DEALING, COURSE OF PERFORMANCE, OR USAGE IN
    THE INDUSTRY. TO THE EXTENT AN IMPLIED WARRANTY OR CONDITION CANNOT BE
    DISCLAIMED, SUCH WARRANTY OR CONDITION IS LIMITED IN DURATION TO THE APPLICABLE
    EXPRESS WARRANTY PERIOD.

6.5 NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY SET
    FORTH IN THIS EULA, SYNTEGRITY'S TOTAL LIABILITY FOR ANY AND ALL CLAIMS ARISING
    OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS EULA AND/OR THE SOFTWARE SHALL NOT EXCEED THE
    TOTAL AMOUNT RECEIVED BY SYNTEGRITY FOR THE APPLICABLE SOFTWARE LICENSE DURING
    THE TWELVE MONTH PERIOD IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE DATE ON WHICH THE RELEVANT
    CLAIM AROSE.

6.6 The Software may come bundled or otherwise be distributed
    with open source or other third party software, which is subject to the terms
    and conditions of the specific license under which it is distributed. OPEN
    SOURCE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR
    OTHERWISE, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY,
    FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING
    TO THE CONTRARY IN THIS EULA, AS IT RELATES TO ANY AND ALL CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF
    OR IN CONNECTION WITH OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE, SYNTEGRITY SHALL HAVE NO LIABILITY
    FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, SPECIAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL
    DAMAGES, HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT,
    STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY
    OUT OF THE USE OF OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
    SUCH DAMAGES. 

6.7 The Software is not designed or intended for high-risk
    applications or use in hazardous environments requiring fail-safe performance,
    such as in the operation of nuclear facilities, aircraft navigation or
    communications systems, air traffic control, life support, weapons systems or in
    any other device or system in which function or malfunction of the software
    could result in death, personal injury or physical or environmental damage. Any
    such use or application by LICENSEE is outside the scope of this license and
    LICENSEE is not authorized to use the Software in any such application.


                       Section 7 - Term and Termination

7.1 This EULA and the licensed granted

    Section 7.

7.2 SYNTEGRITY may terminate this EULA immediately and without
    prior notice of LICENSEE fails to timely pay for the licenses to the Software.
    Should either party commit a material breach of its obligations hereunder (other
    than payment of licensee fees, which is addressed in the immediately preceding
    sentence), the other party may, at its option, terminate this EULA by written
    notice to the party in breach. Such notice shall identify and describe the
    breach upon which termination is based. The breaching party shall have thirty
    (30) days from the effective delivery of the notice to cure such breach, which,
    if affected, shall prevent termination by virtue of such breach.

    become due; (iii) becomes the subject of any voluntary or involuntary bankruptcy
    proceeding under any domestic or foreign bankruptcy or insolvency law; (iv)
    makes or seeks to make a general assignment for the benefit of its creditors; or
    (v) applies for, or consents to, the appointment of a trustee, receiver or
    custodian for a substantial part of its property.

7.4 Upon termination of
    this EULA, LICENSEE will either return to SYNTEGRITY or destroy all copies of
    the Software, License Key and Documentation then in LICENSEE's possession.
    LICENSEE shall, within thirty (30) days after the date of such termination,
    furnish SYNTEGRITY with a certification of compliance.

7.5 The parties
    recognize and agree that their obligations under Sections 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10,
    11, 12, and 13 of this EULA, as well as obligations for payment, shall survive
    the termination of this EULA, and/or the licenses granted hereunder. Except as
    provided in Section 6.3, SYNTEGRITY shall have no obligation upon the
    termination of this EULA to refund any portion of any license fee.

                     Section 8 - Software Export Controls

The Software is subject to the U.S. Export
Administration Regulations and the regulations of other jurisdictions (e.g. the
European Union). Diversion contrary to applicable law is prohibited. Without
limiting the foregoing, LICENSEE agrees that: (i) LICENSEE is not acting on
behalf of any person who is a citizen, national, or resident of, or who is
controlled by the government of any country to which the United States, the
European Union or other applicable government body has prohibited export
transactions (e.g. Iran, North Korea, Sudan and Syria.); (ii) LICENSEE is not
acting on behalf of, any person or entity listed on a relevant list of persons
to whom export is prohibited (e.g. the U.S. Treasury Department list of
Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons, the U.S. Commerce Department
Denied Persons List or Entity List); and (iii) LICENSEE will not use the
Software for any purpose prohibited by applicable law.

                           Section 9 - Usage Data

LICENSEE agrees that SYNTEGRITY may process technical and related
information about LICENSEE'S use of the Software, which may include license
number, online/offline license activation, license expiration, internet protocol
address, hardware identification, operating system, application software,
peripheral hardware, and non-personally identifiable Software usage statistics
to facilitate the provisioning of updates, support, invoicing or online
services. To the extent that this information constitutes personal data,
SYNTEGRITY shall be the controller of such personal data. To the extent that it
acts as a controller, each party shall comply at all times with its obligations
under applicable data protection legislation.

                       Section 10 - Entire Agreement

Unless LICENSEE has entered into another written agreement with
respect to the Software that has been signed by LICENSEE and an authorized
representative of SYNTEGRITY and that conflicts with the terms of this EULA,
this EULA supersedes all prior written or oral agreements, warranties or
representations with respect to use of the Software. No amendment or
modification of this EULA or any provision or attachment of this EULA shall be
effective unless it is in writing and signed by both parties.

                    Section 11 - Governing Law and Forum

The validity, construction and performance of this
EULA shall be governed by the substantive laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia,
U.S.A. (excluding conflicts of law principles). LICENSEE and SYNTEGRITY agree
that any dispute arising out of this EULA shall be instituted in the United
States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, Alexandria Division,
or the courts of the Commonwealth of Virginia located in Fairfax County,
Virginia, and each party irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of
such courts in any such suit, action or proceeding. If any legal action is
undertaken to enforce the terms of this EULA, the prevailing party shall be
entitled to reasonable attorney's fees and costs in addition to any other
relief to which that party may be entitled. This EULA specifically excludes the
United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and
any legislation implementing such Convention, if otherwise applicable. The
parties agree that the provisions of the Uniform Computer Information
Transactions Act ("UCITA"), as it may have been or hereafter may be in effect
in any jurisdiction, shall not apply to this EULA, and the parties waive any and
all rights they may have under any laws(s) adopting UCITA in any
form.

                   Section 12 - U.S. Government End Users

The Software licensed under
this EULA is "commercial computer software" as that term is described in DFAR

Government acquires the Software and Documentation subject to the terms of this
EULA as specified in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 of the Federal Acquisition Regulations

                    Section 13 - Assignment and Benefit

Without the consent of the other party in writing, neither party may
assign this EULA; provided, however, SYNTEGRITY may assign this EULA to another
entity that acquires or has acquired substantially all of the stock or assets of
SYNTEGRITY. This EULA shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of
LICENSEE and SYNTEGRITY and each party's successors, subject to the other
provisions of this Section. This license is granted to LICENSEE only and as such
does not permit LICENSEE to sell, lend, assign, lease or transfer in any other
way any copy of the Software. Any transfer in violation of this provision is not
permitted and may cause this EULA to be terminated with no refund of the
licensing fee paid.
